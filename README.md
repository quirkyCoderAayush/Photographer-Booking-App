# Photographer-Booking-App
This is a Photographer Booking Application. The application has been created with Java, Spring Boot, React, and MySQL. It involves designing a backend for API services, a frontend for user interaction, and database integration for persistent data storage. Additionally, for authentication and authorization, I have used JWT.

Reminders for upcoming bookings.
Project Workflow:
Step 1: Planning & Design
Design the database schema.
Create wireframes for frontend UI.
Define API endpoints.
Step 2: Backend Development
Build REST APIs for CRUD operations.
Implement JWT for secure authentication.
Write services for business logic.
Step 3: Frontend Development
Create React components.
Design responsive layouts with Material-UI or TailwindCSS.
Integrate APIs using Axios.
Step 4: Integration
Connect backend services to the React frontend.
Test end-to-end workflows like user registration, booking, and payment.
Step 5: Testing
Unit testing with JUnit for backend services.
Manual and automated frontend testing.
Step 6: Deployment
Host the backend on AWS/Heroku.
Deploy the frontend on Vercel/Netlify.
Use Docker for containerization if necessary.
Database Schema (Simplified):
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE Users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    password VARCHAR(255),
    role ENUM('CLIENT', 'PHOTOGRAPHER', 'ADMIN'),
    location VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE Photographers (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    portfolio_url TEXT,
    availability JSON,
    pricing_details JSON,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES Users(id)
);

CREATE TABLE Bookings (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    client_id INT,
    photographer_id INT,
    booking_date DATE,
    total_amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    status ENUM('PENDING', 'CONFIRMED', 'COMPLETED', 'CANCELLED'),
    FOREIGN KEY (client_id) REFERENCES Users(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (photographer_id) REFERENCES Photographers(id)
);

CREATE TABLE Reviews (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    client_id INT,
    photographer_id INT,
    rating INT CHECK (rating BETWEEN 1 AND 5),
    feedback TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (client_id) REFERENCES Users(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (photographer_id) REFERENCES Photographers(id)
);
Potential Challenges:
Real-time Availability:
Handling simultaneous bookings requires efficient concurrency management.
Scalability:
Optimizing database queries and backend services for high traffic.
Security:
Protecting sensitive data like passwords and payment details.
Future Enhancements:
Mobile App:
Develop a mobile app for Android and iOS using React Native.
AI Recommendation:
Suggest photographers based on user preferences and past bookings.
Chat Integration:
Add real-time chat between clients and photographers.
Subscription Model:
Offer premium features to photographers for better visibility.
This detailed plan ensures a structured development approach and highlights the scalability and security of the Photographer Booking Application.
