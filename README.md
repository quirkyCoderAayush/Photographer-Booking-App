# Photographer-Booking-App
This is a Photographer Booking Application. The application has been created with Java, Spring Boot, React, and MySQL. It involves designing a backend for API services, a frontend for user interaction, and database integration for persistent data storage. Additionally, for authentication and authorization I have used JWT.
